# 🗣️ Our Mission & Vision

**_ˮMillions of people play everyday but are not rewarded for thatˮ_**

Over the years, the **video game industry** has managed to establish itself as the **leading cultural activity**.
Video games **attract and unite** populations regardless of age, gender or social category. **Hundreds of millions of people** spend time every day on their phones, computers or consoles **playing** their favorite games **without being able** to **win prizes**, **cash prizes**, or **more generally money**.

We want that **the time spent playing, can be remunerative without being a professional player**, that **each amateur player can**, after a day at school or at work, **earn money by playing** with his friends on their favorite games.
