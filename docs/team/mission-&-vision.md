# 🗣️ Our Vision & Mission

## Our Vision

**Esports** is a young economy that **needs to evolve.**

Video games industry and Esports is booming those years, with **3.2 billion gamers worldwide**, and will keep doing so with the rise of the millennials generation.

Pro competitions are well developed with big Esports events, over **½ billion $ cash-prize** since 1998.

**Amateurs** players and **semi-pros** struggle to access competitions, where pro-players & leagues capture the most of the value.

Amateur market are left on the sidelines by the major video game operators even though they represent a potential of several millions players.

## Our Mission: Empowering Gamers

We want each player to be able to earn money by playing with his friends on their favorite games

This is a reality that we can be confronted with in our daily lives and it is with this in mind that we have created and launched Noobizes.

We wish that **the time spent playing, can be remunerative without being a professional player**, that each amateur player can, after a day at school or at work, earn money by playing with his friends on their favorite games.

To put it simply : **to mix the useful with the pleasant thanks to Noobizes.**
