# Utility token $NBZ

**The NBZ utility token** also **provides access to the platform's services** as the $sNBZ (challenge, tournament ...).

But unlike the NBZ stable token, it is **exposed to the variations of the crypto market** but it allows users to have **access to additional services**.

## $NBZ utility

To encourage the use of our utility token we have created benefits that are strictly reserved for its use.

- Withdraw
- Challenge
- Tournament participation/organization
- Pool betting
- Marketplace
- Purchase of membership cards and bonuses on the different fees
- Purchase of physical event tickets (incentive to be paid in NBZ$)
- Secondary market on trophies and bonuses
- Partnership with games (merch, NFT ...)
- Governance
- Staking
