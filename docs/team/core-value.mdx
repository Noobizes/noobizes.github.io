# âœ¨ Our Core Value

At Noobizes we think **it is important to have strong values**, **incentivize players** and **be transparent** with everyone, so we organize ourselves through **four major** values that are our **core values**

## Security

We aim to **provide gamers** with a **secure** and **trustful environment**, **audited** and **certified**, an environment based on the blockchain:

- **Decentralized**
- **Secure**
- **Immutable**
- **Transparent**

But also based on the principle of **Proof of Victory**:

- **Results directly from trusted source** (games API, blockchain, realtime)
- Stored on blockchain for **traceability** and **security**

## Equity

The **equity** of a virtuous environment where **each player**, **regardless of his skills**, can **progress** and **participate** in competitions taking into account his level.

Equity of **prize pool**, allow **each gamers** to **make money by competing** on his **favorite games** in **laddered tournaments**, or **challenges**.

We think that **any player should be able to start making money at the beginning of his career**, we don't aim to be the new pro scene but a **virtuous** and **fair platform** in the eyes of each player.
