    <summary>What is an ICO ?</summary>
    <p>
      An initial coin offering (ICO) or initial currency offering is a type of
      funding using cryptocurrencies. <br />
      It is often a form of crowdfunding, although a private ICO which does not seek
      public investment is also possible.
      <br />
      <br />
      Investors receive cryptocurrency in exchange for their financial
      contributions. <br />
      In many ways, an ICO is the cryptocurrency version of an initial public offering
      (IPO) in the stock market.
