# âœ¨ Our Core Value

At Noobizes we think **it is important to have strong values**, **incentivize players** and **be transparent** with everyone, so we organize ourselves through **four major** values that are our **core values**

## Security

We aim to **provide gamers** with a **secure** and **trustful environment**, **audited** and **certified**, an environment based on the blockchain:

- **Decentralized**
- **Secure**
- **Immutable**
- **Transparent**

But also based on the principle of **Proof of Victory**:

- **Results directly from trusted source** (games API, blockchain, realtime)
- Stored on blockchain for **traceability** and **security**

## Equity

The **equity** of a virtuous environment where **each player**, **regardless of his skills**, can **progress** and **participate** in competitions taking into account his level.

Equity of **prize pool**, allow **each gamers** to **make money by competing** on his **favorite games** in **laddered tournaments**, or **challenges**.

We think that **any player should be able to start making money at the beginning of his career**, we don't aim to be the new pro scene but a **virtuous** and **fair platform** in the eyes of each player.

## Sharing

At Noobizes **we think that a new model of society can exist**, we choose to **share our success with the ecosystem**.

It mean that we realize a **tokenomic** _(token economic model)_ **allowing players** and also **investors to benefit from our business model**.

On Noobizes you can generate **active income** by participating in **challenges** and **tournaments**, but also **passive income** by **staking** your tokens.

We also think that it is important to **reward the most involved players** in the **protocol**.

## Social

**Gamers** are part of one of the **most engaged communities**, it is important that all these gamers are able to **generate an income** through their passion on a **decentralized protocol**, created **by gamers for gamers**.

**Gaming** is a **social activity**, even more when it comes to **team competitive games**, we aim to **allow players** to **easily find new mates** and **keep gaming a social things**, by **organizing fun or competitive tournament**.
