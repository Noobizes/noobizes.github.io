# üèÜ Proof Of Victory

The **Proof of Victory** principle consists of **high value data**. _*<font size="2">i.e : verified data coming directly from the games</font>*_

We can retrieve data with :

<div style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', position: 'relative'}}>
<img src="/img/pov.png" width="35%" style={{ position: 'absolute', right: '0', top: '0', transform: 'translateY(-50%)' }} />

- **Official games API**
- **Realtime application**
- **Blockchain stored data**

</div>

Those three way of retrieving data must cover every games in the world right now.

Those **data** is then **used to establish a score** according to **each game** and **type of game** played by the users, this **score and game result** are then **stored in blockchain**.

**Storing** the data **in blockchain** then **allows to obtain** a **traceability** of the results and the various tournaments, which then establishes an **immutable track record** allowing the **certification of victories and defeats**.

All those features allow us to provide a **trustfull system** for players, and **many application can be built on top** of this :

- **Gamer CV**
- **Gamer Reputation**
- **Tournament official certification**
