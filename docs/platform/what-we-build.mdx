# üõ†Ô∏è What are we building ?

Noobizes uses the **blockchain technology** to bring the **Proof of Victory** to the gaming ecosystem and develop more **powerful services** such as _automated victory check, trustable track record, community governance_ to a **broader audience** than today not only for competitive gamers but also for esports amateurs and social gamers.

## Decentralized application

We are developing a **web decentralized application**, focusing on the **UI/UX** for a **better gamers exeperience**.

The main goal of this application is to **monetize video games** for the players, **democratize access to Esports** and **give more power to gamers** by sharing the revenue of the ecosystem.

By deploying a **trustful environment** using games API, blockchain or realtime based results, we aim to be the **first trustable Esports platform** using web3.

## Realtime game tracking

We are also developing a **desktop app** that will be used for PC gamers to allow **realtime results** and many **more custom modes** on differents games.

This app will have two "views" one desktop view if you are not in game, really near as the decentralized application, and one view ingame.

The **overlay ingame** will allow gamers to have a **better experience**, and participate in challenges or tournament without going back to desktop, **use Noobizes directly in your game !**

This also allow to **deploy AI anticheat features**, and use a comparison system between you and your opponent to **ensure the validity of the results**.

This track record allow:

- Generate **statistics analysis**
- **Verified gamers** and **accounts** to limit fake and smurf
