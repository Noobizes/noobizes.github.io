# ðŸ’» How it works

You can claim your OG NFT [here](https://whitelist.noobizes.com)

**You have to win or get a whitelist spot**, after which you can fill in a form and give us a wallet address.

When your **wallet address** is whitelisted, you will be able to **claim the NFT OG _(for free)_**.

After that, **you can link/verify your wallet** on [_*ðŸ¤œâ”‚verify-whitelist*_](https://discord.gg/vzYeRD7UsU) channel in our Discord.

_*<font size="2">(You can try to buy your NFT OG on the secondary market, but it is unlikely that a real OG will sell theirs)</font>*_

There is many way to get a Whitelist:

- Winning a giveaway
- Complete a quest (Crew3)
- Get reward by another OG member (if he win another WL)
