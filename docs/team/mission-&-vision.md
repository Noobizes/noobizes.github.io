# üó£Ô∏è Our Vision & Mission

## Our Vision

### Market Vision

**Esports** is a young economy that **needs to evolve.**

Video games industry and Esports is booming those years, with **3.2 billion gamers worldwide**, and will keep doing so with the rise of the millennials generation.

Pro competitions are well developed with big Esports events, over **¬Ω billion $ cash-prize** since 1998.

**Amateurs** players and **semi-pros** struggle to access competitions, where pro-players & leagues capture the most of the value.

Amateur market are left on the sidelines by the major video game operators even though they represent a potential of several millions players.

### Company Vision

We think that **Noobizes must be a secure** and **trustfull place for gamers**, **blockchain allow this**, but not only this it allow us also **transparency with our users**.

With this new way of defining what is a company, **we want to involve all our users in the process**, how can we **design and deploy the best protocol** and products on top of that.

We want to **take our time** to see how to **integrate governance principles** that would **allow each user** or **investor** to **participate in the evolution of the project**.

**Betting can be an addiction** and it is also **important for us** to put in place **risk reduction systems** whether it be through adjustable **parameters or prevention**

## Our Mission: Empowering Gamers

**We want each player to be able to earn money by playing with his friends on their favorite games**

This is a reality that we can be confronted with in our daily lives and it is with this in mind that we have created and launched Noobizes.

We wish that¬†**the time spent playing, can be remunerative without being a professional player**, that each amateur player can, after a day at school or at work, earn money by playing with his friends on their favorite games.

To put it simply :¬†**to mix the useful with the pleasant thanks to Noobizes.**
