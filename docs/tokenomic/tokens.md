# ðŸª™ Tokens

Much more than an esport platform, we build a virtuous, secure and transparent web3 ecosystem that works with two tokens:
the **NBZ utility token** and the **NBZ stable token**. Those two tokens are complementary in their uses and the functioning of the platform.

## sNBZ

**The NBZ stable token** will allow **players who do not want to be exposed to the crypto market** to use our services. This will allow us to reach the majority of players who are not familiar with crypto.

**The NBZ stable will allow gamers to use the services bellow:**

- Withdraw
- Challenge
- Tournament
- Tournament organization
- Pool betting

## NBZ

**The NBZ utility token** also **provides access to the platform's services**. Unlike the NBZ stable token, it is **exposed to the variations of the crypto market** but it allows users to have **access to additional services**.

To encourage the use of our utility token we have created benefits that are strictly reserved for its use.

- NBZ utility
  - Marketplace
  - Purchase of membership cards and bonuses on the different fees
  - Purchase of physical event tickets (incentive to be paid in NBZ$)
  - Secondary market on trophies and bonuses
  - Partnership with games (merch, NFT ...)
  - Governance
  - Staking
