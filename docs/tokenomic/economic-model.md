# ðŸ“Š Economic model

Noobizes is **developping a new economic model**, on an underdeveloped segment of the **gaming market** , by **allowing any players from amateur to pro**, to **organize** and **participate** in **challenges/tournaments** so that they can **generate an active income** playing on video games.

We are **working to set up a virtuous financial model** in which **part of the revenues generated** by the platform would be **redistributed to the ecosystem**. Our goal is to **allow gamers to monetize their playing time**, and therefore earn money, in a "play and earn" logic.

## How it works ?

Our **economic model** is **based on** a **commission system** who has been designed and developed to **allow Noobizes to generate revenue** while **remaining competitive** and **acceptable to users**. This system **permit to guarantees** the **operation and development** of the protocol.

Beyond **financing the operation of Noobizes**, this also allow the company to **redistribute its wealth with users**.

**40% of the money collected** by the commissions are **allocated to the community fund** and therefore **to the users of the platform**.

You can access the detailed operation of the commission system in our [white paper](#)

## Economic opportunity

If our main source of revenue is based on the commission system, **we want to multiply our sources of income** and **diversify our reveneue streams**.

We aim to deploy different services that will allow, at different times, the company to generate more income like :

- Creation of a **NBZ championship**
- Organization of **physical events**
- Sponsors, partnerships, adsâ€¦
- Creation of a professional Esport team

This is our way of **setting up a virtuous and transparent economic model** that **benefits everyone**.
